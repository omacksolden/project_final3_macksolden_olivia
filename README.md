# Resources

- Aside from jQuery plugins, I did	not	use	any resources	outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.
- jQuery Plugins:
	- [Owl Carousel](http://www.owlcarousel.owlgraphic.com/) - This plugin creates a responsive photo carousel that can scroll from side to side. I found it on your list of plugins in the discussion board. On my site, it can be found on the home page underneath the welcome section.
	- [Fixed Background](http://nnattawat.github.io/fixedBG/) - This plugin allows the user to have a fixed background image while scrolling through the content of a page. This can be found on both pages of my site.

# Comments

For the custom jQuery and Javascript code, I used our class resources and lectures. The Javascript code changes placeholder text at the top of the menu to the header, "MENU". The custom jQuery allows another photo to slide ontop of an image on hover on the homepage.

I honestly was a little intimidated before working on this project, but using everything we've learned throughout the semester was an incredibly rewarding feeling! I think this was the project where I looked back on all the feedback I've gotten from from homeworks and projects and made sure to try an implement that on the site. This project definitely had its issues, but overall I thought that the ability I've learned to work through the issues to figure out what's wrong and fix it, is truly valuable. :) Thanks so much for everything!
